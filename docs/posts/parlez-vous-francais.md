Parlez-vous Français?

<!-- more -->

I'll admit it. It's been a long time since I wrote anything here in this blog.
There were some drafts here and there, but no contents came to light. Now I'm back
with a new initiative and news ideias. I now, I now, you've seen this film
before. But, at least, I'm trying my best, because a lot of ups and downs happened in my
life since january.
Anyway, let's stop rambling around here I get to the point.

During March and April in this year,
I've spent 30 days in Europe visiting French, Spain and Portugal. It was a wonderful
trip and Paris was a special place to be. There, I definely understood the meaning
of monument, and hearing french language live was awesome. I've already tried to
learn french with Duolingo and Babbel, but coudn't go any further because, I must confess, I
can't engage with these apps at all (I'll make a post about that later). The point is:
the experince in Paris ignited the desire to roll up my sleeves and learn french
once and for all.
It is true I don't have any practial reason to learn it, but hey, to learn
something new just for the sake of leaning, also counts as something valid to do
for yourself. Besides I fell in love with France and I'm looking forward to visit it
many more times. And the difference betweeen what I did before and now, when it comes
to learn a language, is the approach. Insted of focusing in these apps, I'll leang from 
contents that I do like! No more phrases without context and repetitive contents.

So, that's my updates for today. See you in the next post. À bientôt!
